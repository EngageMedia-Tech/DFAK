SocialTIC is a Mexican NGO with a Latin American perspective, it focuses on enabling changemakers (activists, advocates, civil society organizations and independent media committed to social justice) by strengthening their advocacy, outreach and influence capacities through the strategic and secure use of digital technology and data. Our vision aims to strengthen strategically advocates that work everyday to build a more equal, fairer, open, diverse and inclusive 21st Century societies.

SocialTIC provides specialized digital security training, organizational audits and emergency response to activists, civil society organizations and journalists. We also work alongside these groups so that they can better address, communicate and respond to the challenges they face on digital privacy, violence and cybersecurity. SocialTIC has trained Latin-American change makers and has developed a training curriculum and organizational security audits combining the expertise of other international specialized organizations and our on-the-ground experience.
