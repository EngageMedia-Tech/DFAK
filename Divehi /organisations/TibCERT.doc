The Tibetan Computer Emergency Readiness Team (TibCERT) seeks to create a formal, coalition-based structure for reducing and mitigating online threats in the Tibetan community, as well as to expand Tibetansâ€™ technical research capacity on threats in the diaspora and surveillance and censorship inside Tibet, ultimately ensuring greater online freedom and security for Tibetan society as a whole.

TibCERT's mission includes:

- Creating and sustaining a platform for long-term collaboration between stakeholders in the Tibetan community on digital security issues and needs,
- Deepening connections and developing a formal process for collaboration between Tibetans and global malware and cybersecurity researchers to ensure mutually beneficial sharing,
- Increasing the resources available to Tibetans to defend against and mitigate online attacks by regularly publicizing information and recommendations on threats facing the community,
- Helping Tibetans in Tibet circumvent censorship and surveillance by providing regular, detailed information and analysis, as well as potential solutions.
