# Digital First Aid Kit Localization: Sinhala, Tamil, and Divehi

Welcome to the localization project for the **Digital First Aid Kit**, an initiative supported by the **Greater Internet Freedom** project, in partnership with **EngageMedia**. This repository contains localized versions of the Digital First Aid Kit in **Sinhala**, **Tamil**, and **Divehi**.

## About the Project

The Digital First Aid Kit is a community-driven resource that provides advice on how to handle digital emergencies, focusing on security and safety for individuals and organizations. This project aims to make the kit more accessible to communities in South Asia by translating it into Sinhala, Tamil, and Divehi.

While the initial translation work has been completed, **this project is still in progress**. We invite contributors to help improve the quality of the translations, correct any markup errors, and enhance the overall usability of the localized versions.
